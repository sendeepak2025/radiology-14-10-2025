The previous AI engineer successfully transformed a nascent medical imaging viewer into a more robust, feature-rich application. The journey began with critical debugging of the 3D viewer and authentication, followed by integrating Orthanc PACS and an AI detection service using Google Gemini. A significant undertaking was the development of a multi-tenant Machine Management System, which included both backend and frontend components.

The recent work focused on fulfilling an Enterprise Solution roadmap, systematically implementing improvements across infrastructure, performance, search, and clinical workflow. Key achievements include a comprehensive error handling system, health monitoring, MongoDB backups, database indexing, API pagination and compression, and an advanced search/filter interface. The engineer also initiated the clinical workflow features by implementing report templates (backend complete) and starting frontend report editor and signature components. The 3D viewer issue was thoroughly investigated and found to be a data problem (lack of multi-slice studies) rather than a VTK.js loading fault, which was verified after successfully uploading new multi-slice studies. The trajectory ends with the engineer implementing frontend components for the Clinical Workflow phase.

<product_requirements>
The initial request was to debug an Advanced Medical Imaging Viewer exhibiting critical issues: a black image in the 3D viewer, login 500 errors, and missing studies, despite having 300 studies in our cloud. The long-term vision was a web application for CT/PAT machine communication, cloud data storage, provider reporting, and AI integration (Google Gemini 2.0 Flash) for radiology, specifically for the USA only. Later, a Machine Management System was requested for logged-in providers to view/add machine IPs, requiring robust backend and user-friendly frontend. Most recently, the user opted for a Complete Enterprise Solution, a comprehensive upgrade encompassing security, error handling, data validation, performance optimization, advanced UX (search, comparison, export, window/level presets), clinical workflow features (report templates, digital signatures, critical alerts, worklist), enhanced AI, advanced viewer capabilities (MPR, MIP/MinIP, image fusion, segmentation), analytics, and mobile support.

-   Integrate the frontend UI components for the Machine Management System (navigation links and routes for  or  not fully implemented).
-   Complete the remaining frontend components for Phase 4 (Clinical Workflow): export functionality, study comparison viewer, and signature capture UI.
-   Address the discrepancy between 300 cloud studies and the current count of studies.

<current_work>
The AI engineer is currently in **Phase 4: Clinical Workflow Features** of implementing the Complete Enterprise Solution. The backend for report templates and patient reports is fully functional, including Mongoose schemas, default data, controllers, and API routes. These backend APIs have been tested and confirmed to seed default templates and retrieve them successfully.

On the frontend, the engineer has begun creating the necessary UI components for the clinical workflow. Specifically, the  for API interaction and the  component for report creation/editing have been successfully created. The engineer was in the process of creating the  when this summary was requested.

Previously, Phase 1 (Infrastructure & Error Handling) and Phase 2 (Performance Optimization) and Phase 3 (Advanced Search and Filters) were completed, including frontend error logging, backend health monitoring, MongoDB backup scripts, input validation, database indexing, and API pagination/compression. The 3D viewer functionality was also clarified; VTK.js loads successfully, and 3D rendering was verified with newly uploaded multi-slice CT studies, confirming the previous black image was due to single-frame data, not a library issue.
